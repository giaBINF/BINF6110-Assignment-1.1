# 1. Introduction
Genomic sequencing has become a fundamental tool in microbial genomics, enabling comprehensive characterization of bacterial genomes and the genetic variation they contain. Advances in sequencing technologies have improved the cost, speed, and accessibility of genome-scale analyses, facilitating the use of both short-read and long-read sequencing platforms<sup>1,2</sup>. These platforms generate either short DNA reads, such as those produced by Illumina sequencing, or long DNA reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT), each with distinct trade-offs in read length, accuracy, and analytical applications. Short-read sequencing produces highly accurate reads typically ranging from tens to hundreds of base pairs, whereas long-read sequencing generates reads spanning several to tens of kilobases<sup>1</sup>. When research objectives prioritize genome assembly and structural resolution, long-read sequencing offers clear advantages<sup>3</sup>. In this study, genome-scale sequencing data were used to reconstruct and analyze the bacterial pathogen _Salmonella enterica_.

Long-read sequencing has improved genome assembly by enabling more accurate reconstruction of complex genomes<sup>4</sup>. During genome assembly, overlapping reads are computationally joined to form contiguous sequences, or contigs, that represent continuous regions of the genome. In bacterial genomes such as _S. enterica_, repetitive elements and plasmids complicate accurate genome reconstruction from short sequencing reads, whereas long-read sequencing can capture these features within single reads<sup>3,5</sup>. For long-read genome assembly, the Flye assembler was selected due to its design for error-prone long-read data and its demonstrated performance on bacterial genomes. Alternative long-read assemblers such as Canu were considered; however, Flye effectively assembles repetitive regions with lower computational requirements, making it well suited for ONT reads<sup>6</sup>. Given the repetitive elements and plasmids in _S. enterica_, Flye balances assembly contiguity with tolerance to ONT sequencing errors<sup>7</sup>.

Following genome assembly, contigs are aligned to reference genomes to assess assembly accuracy and identify large-scale structural variation. Although long reads span repetitive and structurally complex regions, their error rates, particularly for insertions and deletions, limit reliable base-level interpretation. For this reason, genome assemblies are primarily used to evaluate overall genome structure, while accurate identification of small variants requires read-level alignment and variant calling approaches optimized for ONT data<sup>1,8</sup>.

To address challenges associated with base-level variant detection in ONT data, variants were called using Clair3, a deep learning-based variant caller optimized for long-read sequencing technologies. Alternative variant calling approaches, such as short-read–oriented callers, were considered; however, these methods are less effective at modeling systematic error patterns characteristic of nanopore sequencing. Clair3 integrates read alignment and machine learning approaches to improve discrimination between true variants and sequencing artefacts, particularly for insertions and deletions, making it well suited for variant detection in bacterial genomes sequenced using ONT<sup>9</sup>.

# 2. Methods
Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) long-read sequencing data for _S. enterica_ were obtained from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA; accession SRR32410565)10. Raw sequencing reads were provided in FASTQ format and used directly for downstream quality control, genome assembly, and variant calling analyses. Read quality and length distributions were assessed prior to assembly to confirm suitability for long-read de novo genome reconstruction. As the dataset consisted of bacterial whole-genome sequencing data, additional host contamination filtering and heterozygosity estimation were not required.

## 2.2 Oxford Nanopore read quality control

Quality control (QC) of ONT long-read sequencing data was performed using NanoPlot v1.46.2 to evaluate overall sequencing quality and suitability for downstream genome assembly<sup>2</sup>. Summary metrics assessed included read length distribution, read length N50, total read count, and mean read quality score (Q score). NanoPlot was selected because it provides visualization tools specifically designed for ONT data and enables rapid assessment of long-read datasets without extensive preprocessing.

Read length histograms were examined to confirm the presence of long reads appropriate for de novo genome assembly, while bivariate plots of read length versus mean read quality were inspected to identify potential clusters of low-quality reads. QC results were used to determine whether additional filtering or trimming would be required prior to assembly.

## 2.3 Read filtering and preprocessing

Read filtering and trimming were evaluated based on NanoPlot QC results. Filtering would be applied if mean read quality fell below expected thresholds for ONT sequencing, if read length N50 was insufficient for effective long-read assembly, or if large clusters of low-quality reads were observed<sup>3</sup>. In such cases, Filtlong would be used to remove low-quality reads and enforce minimum read length thresholds suitable for long-read assembly<sup>3</sup>.

Aggressive trimming was avoided to prevent unnecessary loss of sequencing depth, as sufficient coverage is critical for robust de novo genome assembly. Based on QC results for this dataset, reads were deemed suitable for assembly with minimal preprocessing and were carried forward without extensive filtering.

## 2.4 De novo genome assembly

De novo genome assembly was performed using Flye v2.9.6, a long-read assembler optimized for error-prone sequencing technologies such as Oxford Nanopore. Flye constructs assemblies using repeat graphs, allowing effective resolution of repetitive genomic regions and plasmids commonly present in bacterial genomes.

Assembly was conducted using parameters appropriate for high-quality ONT data, including the `--nano-hq` option, which assumes an error rate consistent with modern ONT basecalling<sup>2</sup>. Default Flye parameters were otherwise used, with multithreading enabled to optimize computational performance. The resulting draft assembly consisted of contiguous sequences representing chromosomal and plasmid components of the _S. enterica_ genome.

## 2.5 Reference-based alignment of long reads

To support downstream variant analysis, raw ONT reads were aligned directly to a reference genome rather than relying solely on assembled contigs. A reference genome for _S. enterica_ was obtained from the NCBI RefSeq database (accession GCF_000006945.2)<sup>11</sup>. Read-level alignment was performed using Minimap2 v2.30, an aligner designed for long-read sequencing data that balances speed and alignment accuracy.

Alignments were generated using the map-ont preset, which is optimized for the error profile of ONT reads and accounts for long insertions, deletions, and split alignments. Alignment files were sorted and indexed to produce BAM files suitable for downstream variant calling.

## 2.6 Variant calling

Single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertions and deletions (indels) were identified using Clair3, a deep learning-based variant caller optimized for Oxford Nanopore sequencing data<sup>9</sup>. Variant calling was performed using the `--platform` ont parameter to ensure appropriate modeling of ONT-specific error profiles. Variant detection was enabled across all contigs using the `--include_all_ctgs` option to ensure inclusion of plasmid and smaller contigs. Multithreading was used to improve computational efficiency. Output variant call format (VCF) files were compressed, sorted, and indexed for downstream visualization and inspection.

## 2.7 Variant visualization and manual inspection

Variant calls and read alignments were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV; desktop application)<sup>3</sup>. BAM and VCF files were loaded alongside the reference genome to facilitate manual inspection of representative variants. Alignments were colored by base, and coverage tracks were adjusted to enable clear visualization of variant support.

Manual inspection focused on evaluating read-level evidence for selected variants, including consistency across multiple reads, strand support, and positional stability within alignments. Particular attention was paid to regions prone to ONT sequencing artefacts, such as homopolymer tracts and low-complexity regions.

# 4. Discussion
Oxford Nanopore sequencing of _S. enterica_ generated high coverage data that enabled genome assembly and variant detection relative to the reference strain. A total of 9,738 single nucleotide variants and 530 indels were identified. Among SNVs, 3,149 were missense, 4,920 synonymous, and 1,636 intergenic [(Table 1)](#table-1). The large number of missense variants may indicate meaningful protein sequence divergence between the sample and reference strain. Assembly produced four contigs including two large chromosomal contigs, one circular plasmid contig (~109 kb), and one small fragment (~6 kb) [(Table 3)](#table-3). The circular contig is consistent with the expected structure of the pSLT virulence plasmid, indicating successful recovery of plasmid architecture using long-read sequencing. High average depth (~154×) and >94% read mapping support the overall quality of the assembly<sup>12</sup>.

IGV visualization demonstrated strong read support for the selected variants, with most reads containing the alternate allele. Variants were observed in both plasmid and chromosomal genes. On the pSLT plasmid, mutations in PSLT068 (outer membrane lipoprotein involved in surface exclusion) may influence plasmid conjugation or host interaction dynamics<sup>12</sup>. On the chromosome, variants were identified in STM1022, which encodes a prophage antitermination protein within the Gifsy-2 region. Previous work has shown that amino acid changes in STM1022 may alter protein structure and function, potentially affecting phage-related gene regulation. Because prophage-associated genes contribute to genomic diversity and phage susceptibility in _Salmonella Typhimurium_, mutations in STM1022 may reflect biologically meaningful sequence divergence rather than neutral variation<sup>13</sup>.

Overall, the combination of high coverage, circular plasmid recovery, and strong per-read variant support indicates that the observed polymorphisms reflect true genomic divergence rather than technical artifact. These findings highlight both the utility of long-read sequencing for resolving plasmid structure and its effectiveness for identifying biologically relevant variation in bacterial genomes.
